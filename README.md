# Discord.py-Interactive-Dice-Roller
An interactive dice roller COG for Discord.py Bots

**Setup**
1. Have a Discord.py bot (Quickstart available at https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html)
2. Assuming you're using the minimal quickstart bot, place the cog in the same folder as your bot. 
3. Add    ```client.load_extension('COG_interactive_dice_roller')``` somewhere in the code of your bot.
4. Run the minimal bot.
5. Type ```!r``` or ```!roll ``` in the Discord server chat where the bot is setup to see the dice roller in action.
